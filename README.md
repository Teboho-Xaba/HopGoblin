# HopGoblin

This HopGoblin Laptop store is a prototype of an eCommerce web app that I want to build. This prototype is mostly static and has a bit of Javascript. The next one will include a lot of Javascript (DOM Manipulation and API calls), leading to the one I'll build using React, then one with Next.js and the final one as a fullstack app (with React Native with remix and shopify as add-ons)
